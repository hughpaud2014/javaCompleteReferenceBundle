## Explanation of this example
Floating-point types represent numbers with fractional parts. Java has two such types: double (64 bits) and float (32 bits). These types can store only a limited number of significant decimal digits (~6-7 for float and ~14-16 for double). Usually, you will use the double type in practice.

<em>double 8 bytes	Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits</em>
