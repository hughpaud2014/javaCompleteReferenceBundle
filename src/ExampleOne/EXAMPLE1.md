## Explanation of this example
Every line of code that runs in Java must have a class. In the `FirstSimpleJavaApp.java`, we named the class FirstSimpleJavaApp, a class should always start with an uppercase first letter.

Note: Java is case-sensitive: "MyClass" and "myclass" have different meanings.

The name of the java file must match the class name. When saving the file, save it using the class name and add ".java" to the end of the file name. To run the example above on your computer,
make sure that Java is properly installed: Go to W3 schools [how to get started](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_getstarted.asp>) for how to install Java.

## The main Method
The main() method is required and you will see it in every Java program:

- public static void main(String args[])

Any code inside the main() method will be executed. At this time keywords before and after main are not important to understand. As the puzzle pieces become to fall in place, 
you will get to learn about them.
